                        Bruce started university in late 2019 and found the shift to self-directed learning challenging. He struggled to find enough practice materials for his studies. To address this, he teamed up with his brother, a software developer, to create Quiz-Blog, a website with Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to help students like himself. Originally focused on health sciences, Quiz-Blog now offers resources for various subjects and aims to assist students in Rwanda and worldwide in improving their academic performance.
